This is not my original work and all credit is due to the original creator: `anthonychaseparsons1`
FFplay.exe is required for the PowerShell version to run. For ease of use: unzip the exe and place in C:\Windows\System32.
You can place it anywhere else just make sure to remap the path to the exe in the script.
